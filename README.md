Main purpose of this project is to create basic JS decstack (Node, npm, webpack, babel, npm task runner). Application is created in AngularJS

For devstack creation I have inspired from [medium article](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70).

## Usage
* build: npm run build
* hot deploy server: npm run server
